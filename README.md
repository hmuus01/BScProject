| --- | --- | --- |
|LBR Tests |This folder contains the steps taken to train the model and test the performance of the model using `20 different lBR values` and analysing the performance| ✔ |
|SelectKBest Tests| This folder contains the steps taken to train the model and test the ML models with different `SelectKBest functions` on all the features and how this impacts the performance is analysed | ✔ |
|Threshold Tests | This folder contains the steps taken to train the model and test the performance of the 4 metrics precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy on different threshold values - range(0.0-0.95) | ✔ |
